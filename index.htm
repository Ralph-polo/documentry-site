        I love nature. <a href="#">Nature</a> deals with living plants and
        animals,processes, weather, and physics, such as matter and energy.

        Nature and life is about something different. Sometimes You will face
        many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated.

        We don't inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our
        children.

        It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon
        men's hearts, as for that subtle something, that quality of air that
        emanation from old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary
        spirit.
